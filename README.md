### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hello! A little bit about me. My background is in Computer Systems Engineering and I have worked in the software industry for many years. Currently, I am interested in using machine learning and deep learning to solve Physics problems. As a graduate student persuing a Ph.D in Physics, I am passionate about learning the nature of our universe, space-time and in the bigger picture, what is the meaning and persuit of our lives. My musings are based on my faith as much as science and I consider both to be inseperable. I hope to keep you updated on my adventures here.
